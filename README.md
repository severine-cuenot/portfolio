## Git naming convention

I'm using [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) + [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)

```bash
:gitmoji: type : commit name
```

```bash
:wrench: config : commit name
```

```bash
:rocket: feat : commit name
```

```bash
:art: style : commit name
```

```bash
:hammer: fix : commit name
```

```bash
:memo: doc : commit name
```

```bash
:sparkles: refacto : commit name
```
